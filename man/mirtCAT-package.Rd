\title{Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item Response Theory}
\description{
Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item Response Theory
}
\details{
Provides tools to generate an HTML interface for creating adaptive and 
non-adaptive educational and psychological tests using the shiny package. Suitable for 
applying unidimensional and multidimensional computerized adaptive tests using item 
response theory methodology and for creating simple questionnaires forms to collect
response data directly in R.
