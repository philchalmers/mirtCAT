Title: Computerized Adaptive Testing with Multidimensional Item
        Response Theory
Authors@R: c( person("Phil", family="Chalmers", email =

Description: Provides tools to generate an HTML interface for creating adaptive
    and non-adaptive educational and psychological tests using the shiny
    package (Chalmers (2016) <doi:10.18637/jss.v071.i05>). 
    Suitable for applying unidimensional and multidimensional
    computerized adaptive tests (CAT) using item response theory methodology and for
    creating simple questionnaires forms to collect response data directly in R.
    Additionally, optimal test designs (e.g., "shadow testing") are supported
    for tests which contain a large number of item selection constraints.
    Finally, package contains tools useful for performing Monte Carlo simulations 
    for studying the behavior of computerized adaptive test banks.
